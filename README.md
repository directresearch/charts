# DirectResearch Charts

Webpack based boilerplate for producing charts (Input: ES6, Output: universal library)

[![StyleCI](https://github.styleci.io/repos/137753828/shield?branch=master)](https://github.styleci.io/repos/137753828)

## Features

* Webpack 3 based.
* ES6 as a source.
* Exports in a [umd](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) format so your library works everywhere.
* ES6 test setup with [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/).
* Linting with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/).

## Process

```
ES6 source files
       |
       |
    webpack
       |
       +--- babel, eslint
       |
  ready to use
     library
  in umd format
```

*Have in mind that you have to build your library before publishing. The files under the `lib` folder are the ones that should be distributed.*

## Getting started

1. Build your library
  * Run `yarn install` (recommended) or `npm install` to get the project's dependencies
  * Run `yarn build` or `npm run build` to produce minified version of your library.
2. Development mode
  * Having all the dependencies installed run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`. This command will generate an non-minified version of your library and will run a watcher so you get the compilation on file change.
3. Running the tests
  * Run `yarn test` or `npm run test`

## Scripts

* `yarn build` or `npm run build` - produces production version of your library under the `lib` folder
* `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` - produces development version of your library and runs a watcher
* `yarn test` or `npm run test` - well ... it runs the tests :)
* `yarn test:watch` or `npm run test:watch` - same as above but in a watch mode
